This project was scrapped when we moved to Java for game development. It turns out making a game with a proprietary assembly-like language is impractical, who would have guessed?  
Anyhow, this project includes:  
  -A proprietary assembly-like language, complete with compiler and interpreter  
  -A built-in sprite editor that supports multiple modes  
  -A built-in pallate editor  
  -A built-in song editor  
  -A built-in waveform editor (music uses wavetable synthesis). The waveform editor is unfortuantely very incomplete.  
  -An integrated filesystem and navigator that's stored in the browser's cache as a base64 string  
  -An import/export tool for transfering filesystem data between systems and/or browsers  
  -A tool to actually run the game  
It's really more of a strange IDE than anything. It's all in one HTML file (icons folder not required) and you can develop an entire (small because local storage is limited to 5Mb) game without leaving the page.
